# Batch 1 Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

### 1. Streaming Responses (Simulated)
- Added streaming mode flag (`--stream`) to enable progressive output
- Implemented `get_gpt_chat_response_stream()` functions for both single prompts and conversations
- Simulates streaming by chunking responses with configurable delays
- Works in both interactive and command-line modes
- Properly handles different output formats (plain text streams immediately, others wait for completion)
- Added to Config class for persistent streaming preference

**Security considerations:**
- Buffer size limits to prevent memory exhaustion
- Proper JSON validation for each chunk
- Secure error handling

### 2. Improved Shell Integration
- Enhanced pipe detection using `isatty()` to differentiate between terminal and pipe/file input
- Multi-line input support from pipes/files (reads until EOF)
- Better error messages for missing input
- Created bash and zsh completion scripts for better shell integration:
  - `/scripts/cmdgpt-completion.bash` - Bash completion with option hints
  - `/scripts/cmdgpt-completion.zsh` - Zsh completion with detailed descriptions

### 3. Context Preservation for Error Recovery
- Automatic conversation saving on errors in interactive mode
- Recovery file (`.cmdgpt_recovery.json`) created when API calls fail
- Startup check for recovery files with user prompt to restore
- Recovery file auto-deleted after successful restoration
- Clear instructions provided to users on how to recover

### 4. Auto-Retry with Exponential Backoff
- Implemented `retry_with_backoff()` template function for flexible retry logic
- Added `get_gpt_chat_response_with_retry()` wrapper functions
- Retries on:
  - Rate limits (HTTP 429)
  - Server errors (HTTP 5xx)
  - Network connectivity issues
- Exponential backoff with jitter (prevents thundering herd)
- Configurable max retries (default: 3)
- Maximum delay capped at 30 seconds
- Detailed logging of retry attempts

## Code Quality Improvements
- Well-documented functions with security notes
- Consistent error handling and custom exceptions
- Small, focused functions following single responsibility principle
- Template usage for reusable retry logic
- Proper use of C++17 features

## Tests
- All existing tests pass (71 assertions in 7 test cases)
- Code formatting validated with clang-format
- Static analysis clean with cppcheck
- Build successful on macOS

## Security Enhancements
- Input validation throughout
- Buffer size limits for streaming
- Secure JSON parsing with type checking
- API key redaction in logs
- Certificate verification enabled

## Next Steps
- True SSE streaming would require a different HTTP client library
- Could add configuration for retry parameters
- Consider adding progress indicators for long operations
